# 04 Web API's: Quiz

This code was created so that as a coding boot camp student I can take a timed quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

This quiz consists of 4 questions and a timer that will lose 10 seconds for each wrong quiz.
You start by pressing the start button which starts the timer and displays the first question.
After all the questions have been answered the code will display your score, being how much time you have left.
As well as having your scored display there is an input for to put your intials to enter your score and initials on the highscores list.
The highscores list is presented after you have input your initials.
The highscore list is organised by highest to lowest depending on your score.
Using localStorage highscores will stay unless you click on the clear highscores.
There is a go back button at the highscores page that will take you back to the start of the quiz.
You can also see the highscores list from any part in the quiz by clicking on the View Highscores text in the top left corner.
